As part of my PhD research, I am working on improving context through data annotation. Specifically, I am interested in developing a prompt that can automatically identify and extract medical terms and abbreviations from a given text without altering the original content. The desired output should be in JSON format, structured as follows: { "Medical Terms":[], "Medical Abbreviations":[] }. This prompt aims to streamline the process of identifying and categorizing medical terms and abbreviations within text data for research purposes.

Systematic reviews of prognostic model studies can help identify prognostic models that need to further be validated or are ready to be implemented in healthcare.OBJECTIVES: To provide a step-by-step guidance on how to conduct and read a systematic review of prognostic model studies and to provide an overview of methodology and guidance available for every step of the review progress.SOURCES: Published, peer-reviewed guidance articles.CONTENT: We describe the following steps for conducting a systematic review of prognosis studies: 1) Developing the review question using the Population, Index model, Comparator model, Outcome(s), Timing, Setting format, 2) Searching and selection of articles, 3) Data extraction using the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist, 4) Quality and risk of bias assessment using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment (PROBAST) tool, 5) Analysing data and undertaking quantitative meta-analysis, and 6) Presenting summary of findings, inte, te, or status of the publication. To carry out the systematic review, the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) guidel, The authors did not put any restrictions on the models included in their study regarding the model setting, prediction horizon or outcomes.Data extraction and synthesis Checklists of critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies (CHARMS) and prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used to guide developing of a standardised data extraction form., We critically appraised these models by means of criteria derived from the CHARMS (CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modeling Studies) and PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool)., ist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modeling Studies [CHARMS] and Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsess, t for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME M, the CHARMS recommendations (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies), extracting the information, The CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist was created to provide methodolog, ist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) checklist.
